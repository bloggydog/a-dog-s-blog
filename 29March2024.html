<h1>How large companies in the US pay nearly no taxes</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The other day I stumbled onto an <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/03/15/tesla-netflix-ford-tax-ceo-pay/"><u>article</u></a> talking about how some large U.S companies pay nearly nothing in tax. After reading it for a few minutes, I uncovered a pretty interesting loophole in the United Sates law that enables large companies to pay 0$ in income tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">First of all lets settle the context. In 2017 Donald Trump passed the TCJA: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, bringing big changes to the tax code. Before the USA had one of the highest corporate income tax, but this law brought it down to 21%. The goal of this law was to prevent American companies to relocate their income base to lower taxed jurisdictions. Already, American corporations cried Youpi to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">There is another interesting law in the USA that basically says: loose money now, don&rsquo;t pay tax later. This means that years of loss will reduce your taxes in the following years of profit. (Net operating loss carry forwards). The initial idea of this tax break is to help struggling companies get back on their feet during tough times.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><br></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">An amazing number that really took the breath out of me (not really but you get the idea): 23 companies paid 0% in income tax even though they were profitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">On a positive note, current President Biden signed a nice<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-is-fighting-to-reduce-the-deficit-cut-taxes-for-working-families-and-invest-in-america-by-making-big-corporations-and-the-wealthy-pay-their-fair-share/"><u>&nbsp;law</u></a> in 2022 that should start to reduce the possibility of working this loophole. This law puts a minimum 15% corporate minimum tax on every company.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "><br></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify; ">My personal thought about this</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am no expert, really. But as it seems that the USA are slowly loosing their figure and status of first country in the world, I find that this law makes some sense on paper but really isn&rsquo;t working for them. With the USA currently struggling to finance their activities, mainly Ukraine and now fighting Palestine in a stupid war, large corporations that call themselves American should contribute to financing these activities, especially as most profit is done on American soil. As Trump might get elected again, I fear that tax breaks are reinstated in the law, and American citizens pay the price of their income tax increasing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am really fascinated to see how weird the economy of certain countries work, but I must say that although I see the unfairness I understand the difficulty of pleasing people and corporations. I will think of a solution that I will provide to Biden. You are welcome America.</p>
