    <h1>Welcome to the home page</h1>
    <p> Hello to myself and maybe a few other random seekers,
        This is the start of a blog that I have been thinking about some time now. This blog does not have a clear objective other than a platform for me to think out loud. 
    </p>

    <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently studying computer science in a university that doesn’t allow much free time. Since I am not an exceptional student I do have to work quite a lot to make sure my grades are good and I need to spend a lot of time to understand the difficult concepts that are part of my studies. 
        The rare free time that I do get is spent mostly in two ways. The first way is me being on my phone on social media and the second way is me doing other things. 
        Something about me is that I truly hate being on my phone although I spend a lot of time on it. I hate it so much that it makes me feel truly sad when I use it. 
        So to stop using my phone I do other things and something I truly enjoy is going for a walk and activate my brain to start thinking, something I can absolutely not do while on my phone. 
    </p>  
    <p>I feel like when I go for walks, I get my best ideas and I feel motivated to do interesting things. But, when I come back from these walk I just loose the flow as I will quickly go back on my phone. This is the reason I am starting this blog, I want a platform to talk about my interests, my thoughts and my ideas.
    </p>    
        <p>I want to remain name less as this is just a sort of fun playground for me, so if you do find my name please do not spread the word. Also, I am a computer science student and quite interested in computer security, so if you do find my identity tell me how ! I will then try to protect it and you can try again, like a CTF kind of thing, but the flag is me. 
        </p>
        <h2>Who this blog is for</h2> 
        <p>
        Myself and only myself. I make it public because I think it is cool to have a webpage and I want to experience with html, css etc… There are ways to do this offline but I don’t know I just feel attracted to the idea of having a blog, even if I am the only reader. 
        </p>
        <h2>
        What will this blog be about</h2>
        <p>
        This blog has no red wire, I don’t know yet what I will write about (I need to go for a walk to know that).
        Usually every few weeks I get really interested in a subject and learn a lot about it, so I would like (might not do it) to have a post per week about an interesting subject.
        This being said, like many things I do I stop prematurely. Even this text might not make it on the blog, but I hope I will stick to it as if I do this for a long time it will be a good timeline of my thoughts throughout a period of my life, like a diary.
        </p>
